# NAS2D:GUI

This is a GUI toolkit add-on for NAS2D based applications.

The code in this repository is quite old though a lot of the base functionality remains useful. Since the original development NAS2D has evolved considerably so this code will no longer build against it anymore.

Several other LairWorks projects use GUI components based off this code here but use a much more modern and clean version that does build against the current builds of NAS2D.

Eventually this will be updated and will become a fully fledged add-on module.
